RemObjects Software Chrome Syntax Highlightning Script
======================================================

How to install: copy or move chrome.vim to your $VIMRUNTIME/syntax directory 
  (maybe you will have to replace the foreslash with a backslash depending on
  OS)

How to use: open a source code file for Chrome (.pas) and execute (in VIM)
        :set syntax=chrome
  to make it be sourced.

Please note that this script is definitely not complete. It can't be as I don't 
know what Chrome is capable of. If you have any suggestions how to make it 
better, please mail me at mailto:nullplanwichmann@web.de . If you are able to 
write in german, please do so, because I know my mother tongue better than any 
other language I learned.
Please also note, that I spent one (in numbers: 1) evening on that file, and 
I'm just a 16-year-old student, so don't be afraid to teach me a lesson on 
writing syntax scripts.
I wrote this stuff unix compatible for better enjoyment by unix users, and 
windows users won't bother unziping a tarball instead of a zipfile... if they
have the right unzipper. If they don't, IMHO they don't have the right to call
themselves programmers. IMHO a coder has to be able to cope with tarballs (which 
might be the least prob he ever has to solve).
